Introduction
------------

DinguxCommander is a file manager for Dingoo (Dingux).
It uses two vertical panels side by side, one being the source and the other the
destination, like many 'commander-style' file managers such as Norton Commander
or Midnight Commander.
DinguxCommander allows to:
    o Copy, move and delete multiple files.
    o View a file
    o Execute a file
    o Rename a file or directory
    o Create a new directory
    o Display disk space used by a list of selected files/dirs
    o Display disk information (used, available, total) (does not work on Leapster Explorer)

------------

You'll need the compiler and SDL1.2. When those are installed, clone the repository, then build as normal:
    git clone https://github.com/lfdevvel/dingux_commander/
